ECA-1
=====

A simple seller thingy. Currently buggy and missing quite a few features.

If you use this code, you are crazy.

Current limitations
-------------------

- Receipts are not locked from editing after creation
- Buyers must be students (though new students with no student ID can be added)
- Does not track quantity on hand
- Refunds have to be done through negative quantity transactions (nothing automatic yet)
- QuickBooks export does not include name in name field (because fucking quickbooks)
- THERE ARE NO UNIT TESTS ANYWHERE
